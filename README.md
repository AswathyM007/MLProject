*Fake News Detection*

In our modern era where the internet is ubiquitous, everyone relies on various online resources for news. Along with the increase in the use of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. news spread rapidly among millions of users within a very short span of time. The spread of fake news has far-reaching consequences like the creation of biased opinions to swaying election outcomes for the benefit of certain candidates. Moreover, spammers use appealing news headlines to generate revenue using advertisements via click-baits. In this paper, we aim to perform binary classification of various news articles available online with the help of concepts pertaining to Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. We aim to provide the user with the ability to classify the news as fake or real and also check the authenticity of the website publishing the news.
